This is my little IRC bot programmed in python. 
It's intended purpose is to act as a FAQbot, although it is fairly versatile and modular, and can be modified to fit a variety of tasks.

As of bot version 2-1, it supports plugins which can be loaded an unloaded while the bot is running.
The plugins follow a standard class format demonstrated in the example program Plugin.py.

This is licenced under the freeBSD license.
